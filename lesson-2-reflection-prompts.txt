What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  To tell git to start monitoring commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

  The staging area represents a subset of the working directory and will result in
  an individual commit when issueing the commit command.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

  You can run git diff without additional arguments to check differences between working
  directory and staging area.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

  Collaboration with others. Experimental or big changes, where it would be helpful to
  maintain an operational master branch. Working on different contexts.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

  The commit history does not contain commits from different branches. From HEAD/the current
  commit only the respective parent commits are reachable. To list commits of another
  branch one has to checkout this branch first. Therefore it is important to keep the
  overview on all existing branches.
  Use git branch to get the branch list.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

  A new commit containing all changes from both branches/commits.
  The parent commits will be sorted by timestamp when running git log.
  Identifying the correct parent after merging branches may be difficult.
  Checking changes introduced in one commit compared to its parents can be done using the
  command git show <commit id>
  After merging the new master can reach to both branches, this is why the diagram results in
  one common master.
  

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

  Automatic merging:
  + saves a lot of effort
  - it may not always be immediately clear, how the final merged code will look like
  - can't fully resolve conflicts
  
  Manual merging
  + full control on which changes to adopt
  - tidious
